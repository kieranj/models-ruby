  "description":"This is the virtual version of the original barbell class, which will help you get lean, toned and fit - fast. Les Mills™ Virtual classes are designed for people who cannot get access to our live classes or who want to get a ‘taste’ of a Les Mills™ class before taking a live class with an instructor. The classes are played on a big video screen, with dimmed lighting and pumping surround sound, and are led onscreen by the people who actually choreograph the classes.",
